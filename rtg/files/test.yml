# You must provide a Networks list
Networks:
  A:
    # You must provide a CIDR
    cidr: "10.0.0.0/24"
  B:
    # You can also provide an ip AND a mask instead of a CIDR
    ip: "192.168.0.0"
    mask: "255.255.255.0"
  C:
    ip: "192.168.1.0"
    # The mask may also be a mask length, it doesnt matter whether you give the mask or its length
    mask: "24"
  D:
    # If both a CIDR and a couple IP-mask has been proided, the CIDR will always be the one used to build the network
    cidr: "10.0.1.0/24"
    ip: "10.0.1.0"
    mask: "19"

# You must then provide a Routers list
Routers:
  1: # A router can have the same name as a network, it won't interfere with code
    # still, be aware that using same names for your subnets and routers can be disturbing upon reading
  2:
  3: # if nothing is provided, you still have to put ":" else it will create a bug
  4:
    # One, and only one router, must have internet. It will be called master router in the code
    # and will be used to define default (0.0.0.0/0) routes
    internet: true

# Finally, you must provide a Links or Connections (both names are accepted) list
Links:
  # It works following the router => [subnets] rule
  1: [B, C]
  2: [A, B]
  4: [D]
  3: [C, D]
